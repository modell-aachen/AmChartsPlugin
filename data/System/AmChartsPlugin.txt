---+ AmChartsPlugin

%SHORTDESCRIPTION%

This plugin can be used to render Gantt charts based on project data provided by ProjectsAppContrib.

---++ Usage
The usage of this plugin is currently very limited and only works with specific configurations.

Use the =%<nop>AMCHART%= tag on the project page to load the amChart JavaScript files.
Then anywhere on the prject page provide a div container with the ganttChart id.

Projects need to have exactly 5 phases for the plugin to work.
Phase names in the charts are currently hardcoded (via =%<nop>MAKETEXT%=):
	* Pre-Project phase
	* Feasibility and planning
	* Realisation product design
	* Planning process design
	* Realisation process design

Colors in the chart can be configured via WebPreferences. E.g.:
<verbatim>
   * Set GANTT_PHASE_COLOR = #00FF00
   * Set GANTT_MILESTONE_COLOR = #f46d43
   * Set GANTT_WORKPACKAGE_COLOR = #3288BD
   * Set GANTT_TASK_COLOR = #198F4B
</verbatim>

Additionally tasks in the project need the following fields (besides the required fields for tasks):
	* =StartDate=
	* =DueDate=
	* =Title=
	* =Type=: Needs to be a select with values =Taskpackage=, =Task= and =Milestone=
	* =Parent=: Used for the hierarchy Taskpackage -> Task

   * Set SHORTDESCRIPTION = %$SHORTDESCRIPTION%
